Module 3: CloudWatch Alarms
Assignment

Problem Statement:
You work for XYZ Corporation. To maintain the security of the AWS account and
the resources you have been asked to implement a solution that can help easily
recognize and monitor the different users. Also, you will be monitoring the
machines created by these users for any errors or misconfigurations.

Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Create a CloudWatch billing alarm which goes off when the estimated
charges go above $500.


Access AWS Billing Dashboard:

Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Go to the AWS Billing and Cost Management Dashboard.
Enable Billing Alerts:

Ensure that billing alerts are enabled. To do this, navigate to the "Preferences" page in the AWS Billing and Cost Management Dashboard. Under "Monthly Cost Reports," enable "Receive Billing Alerts."
Create a Billing Alarm:

Navigate to the CloudWatch service in the AWS Management Console.
Create an Alarm:

In the CloudWatch console, click on "Alarms" in the left navigation pane.
Create Alarm:

Click the "Create Alarm" button.
Select Metric:

In the "Create Alarm" wizard, under "Select metric," click on the "Billing" namespace.
Choose a Billing Metric:

Select the "EstimatedCharges" metric.
Define Conditions:

Configure the conditions for your alarm. In this case, you want the alarm to trigger when estimated charges exceed $500. Set the following conditions:
Whenever "EstimatedCharges" is "Greater than" or equal to "500."
Set the threshold for "1 consecutive period" (this means it will trigger as soon as the threshold is crossed).
Set Actions:

Under "Actions," choose the action you want to take when the alarm state is triggered. You can choose to send a notification to an SNS topic or perform other actions like stopping or terminating specific resources. To send a notification, click on the "Create a new topic" link and set up an SNS topic for billing alerts.
Name and Description:

Give your alarm a name and, optionally, a description.
Additional Configuration (Optional):

You can set up additional alarm configuration options, such as enabling/disable actions, specifying an alarm state trigger period, or specifying treat missing data as "breaching" or "not breaching" based on your requirements.
Review and Create:

Review your alarm configuration and click the "Create alarm" button.
Now, your billing alarm is set up, and it will trigger whenever the estimated charges exceed $500. You will receive notifications through the SNS topic you configured when the alarm state changes to "ALARM."

Remember that AWS generates billing data periodically, so there may be a delay before the estimated charges are updated and the alarm is triggered. Additionally, ensure that your AWS account has the necessary permissions to create CloudWatch alarms and access billing data.

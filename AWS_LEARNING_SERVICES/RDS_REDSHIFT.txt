RDS and Red shift:

Any unstructed data:s3
Semi structured
Structured :Relational Databse ACID is defined in the relational database
RDS(MYsql,mssql,postgres,mariaDb,Oracle,Aurora DB),Relations maintained between multiple tables.

Document DB(Mongo DB,Couchbase,DocumentDB,DynamoDB):
which store data in tables with fixed schemas, document databases allow you to store data in a more dynamic and schema-less way
here you can hace flexibility to modify the schema.
NoSQL database: 
example:Catalog System of amazon.com/e-commerce platform
------------------------------
Ever Increasing data example:Uber/Ola apps where drivers are increaing day by day, you want to run
finite set of queries columnar data storage
Cassandra DB/HBase
NOTE:In relational database you can store certain terabites of data only
in NoSQL you can modify the schema at any point
===================================================
Relation ,run  queries a historical data analytics queries on top of my data
RedShift is one if the datawarehousing database
RedShift(OLAP) online analytical processing database
RDS is an example of OLTP database  Online transactional processing database.
It stores data in column format,Compresses data to the great extent,massively parallel processing operations

Example to create RDS in AWS:
  
Steps:
 Initilly create 3 security groups:
  first one  is LBSG with anywhere IP http
  2nd one is http with LBSG IP and ssh with Any where IP.
  3rd one is RDSG with MYsql/Aurora custom WEBSG we have to choose.
 NOTE:
   Primary Database: The primary database is the authoritative source of data. It is the primary instance where all data modifications (inserts, updates, deletes) occur. This database is typically the one actively used by applications for read and write operations.
Secondary Database: A secondary database, also known as a standby database or replica, is a copy of the primary database. It plays a passive role in that it does not accept direct write operations from applications. Instead, it is kept in sync with the primary database to provide data redundancy, backup, or disaster recovery capabilities.
RDS Standard create :
 This option provides more flexibility and control over the configuration of your RDS instance. You can specify various parameters like database engine, instance class, storage type, backup settings, security groups, and other advanced configurations.
  It allows you to fine-tune the database settings to meet specific requirements, making it suitable for complex use cases or applications with unique demands.
  You can choose the instance class (CPU and memory) that best matches your workload's requirements, allowing you to scale up or down based on your needs.
  You have more control over backup retention, maintenance windows, and automated backups, enabling you to tailor these settings to your specific needs.
  You can configure security groups, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) settings, and other network-related parameters as needed for your application's security and networking requirements.
RDS Easy Database:
   As the name suggests, it's a simplified way to create an RDS instance. It is designed for users who want to quickly launch a database instance with default settings. It minimizes the configuration steps, making it easier for beginners to get started.
   Offers limited customization options, and most settings are preconfigured by AWS based on best practices. This simplifies the process but may not be suitable for all scenarios.
   Typically, it selects a predefined instance class based on general-purpose use, which may not be optimized for all workloads.
   It sets default backup and maintenance settings, which are often suitable for basic use cases but may require adjustments for more complex environments.
   Tends to provide a simpler network setup, which may not be as flexible as what you can achieve through the standard create option.

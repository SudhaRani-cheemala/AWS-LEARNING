Cloud Watch:
------------


-> It is a service which helps to monitor AWS services/ resources.
-> Monitoring service:
  -> AWS services
    >eg: EC2 service -> instance
    -> by using the cloud watch we can monitor the instance. -> cpu, memory, network I/O, disk.

    -> whenever we create a instance, it automatically generates predefined metrics.
    -> eg: CPU is a predefined metrics,whenever we create a instance it is automatically generates these metrics in the cloud watch.
    -> if you want to monitor the CPU utilization then we need to configure the metrics, by creating alerts.

  -> we have 3 states:
  1.) OK state
  2.) insufficient state
  3.) Alarm state

if CPU > 80:
-> when cpu utilization is 50 then the status will be on OK state
-> when cpu utilization is 90 then the status will be on Alarm state.
-> when the instance is terminated / stop, then in those cases it will in insufficient state.

-> we can get the details and alerts of the metrics through mail called SNS (simple notofication service).
-> by using this service we ask the cloud watch to send the email -> when it is ok state, Alarm state and insufficient state.
->to configure the SMS we need to create a topic.Topic is nothing but a group.
-> inside this topic we can add emails, we will call this as subscription.
-> by default time for monitoring in cloud watch is 5 minutes.
-> we have 2 types to cloud watch monitoring i.e., 
  1.) default cloud watch monitoring:
  for every 5 minutes it monitors/ checks for which we have configured.
  -> it is less cost.
  2.) detailed cloud watch monitoring: 
  that is we can modify the duration by 10s, etc.
  -> it is more expensive.
  -----------practical-----------

  > from the console goto SNS service.
  >create topic: awsalerts >next step
  >display name: serveralerts {this is just to display instead of from address} > click on create topic
  -*> topic is nothing but a group.
  -> inside that topic we can add subscriptions.
> click on create subscription
>protocol: email
>endpoint: {provide the email address you want to receive the email}
> click on create subscription

*-> we will get confirmation email from the AWS, if we confirm that then only we will receive the email.

> goto the email and click on the confirm the subscription.
*-> we can add any number of subscriptions under one topic.

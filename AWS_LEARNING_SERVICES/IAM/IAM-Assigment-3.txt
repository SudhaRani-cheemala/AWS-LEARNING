the resources you have been asked to implement a solution that can help easily
recognize and monitor the different users.

Tasks To Be Performed:

Steps: Creating a new policy named VPC_Dynamo_policy

Create Policy for full access of dynamoDB,VPC by Json format
   {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [

            "Action": [
                "ec2:Describe*",
                "ec2:Create*",
                "ec2:Modify*",
                "ec2:Delete*",
                "dynamodb:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

step2:

  Switch to the Role and click on the name of the Role IAM_ROLE_Assign 
  Goto Trust relationship and edit trust replationship
 

   {

            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::231772804669:user/user1",
                    "arn:aws:iam::231772804669:user/user2"
                ],
                "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
            },

        }
    ]
}

here add the ARN's of the user1 and user2
"AWS": [

                    "arn:aws:iam::231772804669:user/user2"
                ],

1).Create an EFS and connect it to different ec2 instances(different O/S)
 Steps:
  1).Create two Security groups MywebSecurityGroup with ssh from anywhere on IPV4
     Another Security group MyEFSSecurityGroup with nfs port from MywebSecurityGroup
  2). Create EFS selecting customize standard and mount click on Next 
      select mount target groups with availability zones as us-east1a,us-east1b
      select Next and then Create
  3). Efs will be craeted 
  4). Create 3 ec2 instances with different operating systems(Ubuntu,Amazon Linux,Redhat) by giving Security group as MywebSecurityGroup
      and give network subnet in the regions us-east1a and us-east1b
  5).Now connect to the one of the ec2 instance 
      enter the following commands which have been taken from efs attach section
      initially install efs-utils package
        for amazon-linux--> sudo yum -y install amazon-efs-utils
         now navigate to the efs section click on Attach
         from there take the efs mount helper command and paste
		    sudo yum -y install amazon-efs-utils
		    mkdir /efs 
		    sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-056150db2ed705dfe:/ efs(here replace efs with /efs)
			df -h
			here you will find new file system with mounted on /efs
         		 
	    for Ubuntu server
		   sudo apt-get imstall nfs-common-y
		   mkdir /myefs 
		   navigate to Using the NFS client:
		   sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-056150db2ed705dfe.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /myefs
		   repalce efs with /myefs

  	  
       for RedHat server:
	        sudo yum install nfs-utils-y
			mkdir /myefs
			sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-056150db2ed705dfe.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /myefs
			df -h

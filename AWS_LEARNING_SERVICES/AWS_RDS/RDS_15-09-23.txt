RDS(Relational Database Services): 
Relational database:
   it has the ACID properties,so if you do any transaction the exact balance amout be shown
   this is only single powerful machine which is doing all trasactions for you

NOSQL: it is multinode database,but in this if it hits to server if these databases not sync wth each other the older data will come.
        so it shows older amount only.
        typically these nosql databases are distributed in different places it could be in sigle Az or multiple Az's.
        ACID is not guaranteed i NOSQL databases
        if ACID properties are not important for you go for the NOSQL
        otherwise choose Relational
        - in this relationships may not be maintained
        example: for banking transaction we will use combination of database type

--------------------------------Another database catagory---------------------
Relatios, run queries against a historical data,analytics queries  on top of my data
Example:
  We have different regions with profit table
  APAC    $20mi
  USAE    $30mi
  EMEA    $40mi

  Profit earned for APAC + EMEA together
